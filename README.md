# Forkify Web App

Welcome to the Forkify Recipe App — a culmination of 68 hours of comprehensive learning, integrating modern Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, Asynchronous JavaScript techniques, MVC Architecture Design, and seamless API integrations. This was the final project for the Udemy "The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!" course, instructed by Jonas Schmedtmann.

**Overview**  
The Forkify Recipe App enables users to discover and explore recipes effortlessly using the Forkify API (created by the course instructor).
